# Balance Changes (CM)
<ol>
    <li>TODO summaries for all 3 mods so people know at a glance what they're getting into.</li>
    <li>TODO change text for everything in readme_new that needs it (list them out)</li>
    <li>EVENTS:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>(TODO more events for Lifeform Scanner just like Twinge. Like wherever a Slug is used, LRS, high level sensors, or even more, like people hiding in crates. Actually, some LRS blues should be replaced with Life Scanner if it's against lifeforms)</li>
    </ol>
