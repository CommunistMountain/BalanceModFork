    <li>TODO summaries for all 3 mods so people know at a glance what they're getting into.</li>
    <li>TODO change text for everything in readme_new that needs it (list them out)</li>
    <li>TODO HS branches. Any gameplay-affecting things should have an associated setting in hyperspace.xml. Then make changes accordingly in my mods (e.g. review rewardScaling). For scaleDRA, check if it's OK to not add the value XML tag, then add value in hyperspace.xml</li>
    <li>EVENTS:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>More events for Lifeform Scanner. Like wherever a Slug is used, LRS, high level sensors, or even more, like people hiding in crates. Actually, some LRS blues should be replaced with Life Scanner if it's against lifeforms</li>

Low priority:

Fix Distraction Buoys message not saying the correct fleet delay (actual fleet delay is correct)

remove external doors on enemies (txt files: 1 on rebel_long, 1 on boss_2 and boss_2_easy, 2 on boss_3 and boss_3_easy)

consider changing reactor amounts (only relevant for plasma storms)

review weapon cooldowns and projectile speeds? should probably arrive in this order: bomb, flak, missile, ion, crystal, laser, beam

Teleport works on own ship

Add graphics changes for these weapons that share the same sprite:
1. All bombs
2. Adv. Flak and Flak I
3. Dual Lasers and Burst Laser I (add a pip to Burst Laser I like II and III?)
4. Heavy Laser I and Heavy Pierce I
5. Hull Laser I and Hull Laser II (Mike made a mod for this)
6. Laser Charger (S) and Laser Charger
7. Leto Missile, Artemis Missile, Artemis Missile (enemy) and Pegasus Missile
8. Hermes Missile, Breach Missile and Hull Missile
    OR if only considering weapons that enemies can use:
1. Small Bomb, Fire Bomb, Ion Bomb, Stun Bomb, Lock Bomb
2. Leto Missile, Artemis Missile (enemy)
3. Hermes Missile, Breach Missile
