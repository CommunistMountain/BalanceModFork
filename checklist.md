# Balance Changes (CM)
<ol>
    <li>TODO summaries for all 3 mods so people know at a glance what they're getting into.</li>
    <li>TODO change text for everything in readme_new that needs it (list them out)</li>
    <li>WEAPONS:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Repair Burst: Now also instantly puts out fires, seals breaches, and sets the room's oxygen amount to 100% (though if it's a room with open external doors, it will become instantly vacuum again). (TODO: test if all these features work. Also check that o2 works against auto and lanius)</li>
        <li>Glaive Beam: Its damage is equal to the number of charges. (todo fix the targeting bug)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>AUGMENTS:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>Drone Recovery Arm (component of Drone Reactor Booster): Drone recovery chance from 100% to 20% (rolled independently for each drone). (TODO recreate the effect, test that it includes/excludes the right drones and recover at the right times e.g. Hull Repair cannot be retrieved, and difference between combat and defense, THEN add the percentage)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>EVENTS:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>(TODO more events for Lifeform Scanner just like Twinge. Like wherever a Slug is used, LRS, high level sensors, or even more, like people hiding in crates. Actually, some LRS blues should be replaced with Life Scanner if it's against lifeforms)</li>
    </ol>
    <li>MECHANICS:</li>
    <ol>
        <li>The rooms of neutral ships are now visible.</li>
        <li>Unpowered space drones can be ionized by enemy ion projectiles.</li>
    </ol>
</ol>
